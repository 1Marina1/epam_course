sword and spear
wall of shields
standing strong
on this their chosen battle field

form the lines
shield by shield

i believe in you 
the heart of the youth
i believe in love 
but the darker it gets the more i do
but the darker it gets the more i do
had to have high high hopes for the living
didn't know how but i always had a winning
